This map asks “what sense of space and place drive geographic patterns of witch-hunting?” By mapping approximately 330 trials over 100 years, I identified the port town of St. Andrews as a hotspot of witchcraft activity. Considering St. Andrews as a sort of micro-historical location, I am asking the following: Is St. Andrews particularly isolated either by a different foundational understanding of Presbyterianism, a geographic feature, or a social custom that the surrounding parishes of Fife do not share?
