I am a scholar of the late medieval and early modern periods (c. 1300-1650). I study the interplay of gender, religion, and society in the British Isles, focusing on Scotland and Ireland. I am currently a Ph.D. student at Clemson University. I received my MA from College of Charleston in 2022 and my BA in 2020 from the University of Alabama.
